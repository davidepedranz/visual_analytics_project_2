\section{Exploring the incidents' temporal distribution}

\subsection*{Question 5.1}
\textit{How do the different types of incidents (as represented by Event Clearance Group) vary in number over the different years? Do you see different types of incidents having the same temporal variation pattern over the same year(s)?}


\subsection*{Question 5.2}
\textit{How do the different types of reported incidents (as represented by Initial Type Group) vary over the 24 hours of a day, for the entire data collection? Are there certain hours having a higher rate of reported incidents?}


\subsection*{Question 5.3}
\textit{How long does it take to clear incidents, as a function of the hour when they were reported? For example, do incidents reported at noon get cleared faster than incidents reported in the middle of the night?}
